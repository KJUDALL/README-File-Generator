  # README File Generator
  ## Description 
    This app is meant to help users worldwide have a more seamless experience creating a README file for their projects. Rather than having to use the GitHub UI, or create a file manually in an IDE, you can now harness the power of your terminal to do this task for you! Take advantage of this helpful tool today and see how much time you can have left on your hands to enjoy other things, like writing JavaScript code!

  ## Installation
  Users can clone this code repo inside their IDE of choice. They must ensure inquirer is being imported and install npm as a package manager. From there, users should ensure that the index and generateMarkdown files are both .js. Next, go to your terminal and run node.js for the index.js file. So long as the user is in the correct file, the terminal should populate prompt messages that the user can respond to.
  ## Usage
  You will clone this repo, install npm as a package manager, confirm you're in the correct file, and run node in the terminal for all the prompt messages to appear. You can add your responses directly from the terminal, and when you're finished, the README file will automatically appear in your project as a newly created file.
